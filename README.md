# 🛠 AI-Powered Calibration Monitoring System 🚀

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Ensuring precise and timely tool calibration is critical for operational efficiency and compliance.  
Traditional tracking methods often lead to *missed deadlines, inefficiencies, and compliance risks*.  

## ✅ Solution Overview
This AI-powered system *predicts calibration schedules, detects anomalies, and automates compliance alerts* using:  
🔹 *LSTM-based Time-Series Forecasting* → Predicts next calibration date  
🔹 *Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection* → Identifies overdue/misaligned calibrations  
🔹 *AI-Generated Compliance Reports* → Uses NLP to automate audits  
🔹 *Automated Alerts* → Sends notifications via Email & Slack  
🔹 *Monitoring Dashboard* → Streamlit app for real-time tracking
